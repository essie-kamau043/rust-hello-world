# 🦀 Rust Beginner’s Toolkit – Kickstart Guide

Welcome! 🎉 This repository is a **beginner-friendly Rust toolkit** built as part of the **Moringa AI Capstone Project**.  
If you’re new to Rust and want to quickly set up your environment, run your first program, and understand the basics — you’re in the right place. 🚀

## 📌 What’s Inside?
- ✅ A simple **Hello World** Rust project  
- 📖 Step-by-step setup instructions  
- 🤖 Notes on using AI prompts to learn Rust faster  
- 🛠️ Common issues beginners face (and fixes)  
- 📚 Helpful learning resources

## 🎯 Why Rust?
Rust is a modern systems programming language designed to be:
- **Safe** 🛡️ (prevents memory errors)
- **Fast** ⚡ (performance like C/C++)
- **Concurrent** 🔀 (handles multiple tasks easily)

💡 Companies like **Dropbox**, **Mozilla**, and **AWS** use Rust to build fast and reliable software.

## ⚡ Quick Start

### 1. Clone this Repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/rust-beginners-toolkit.git
cd rust-beginners-toolkit/hello_world
2. Install Rust
Use the official installer:

Copy code
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
Then reload your environment:

bash
Copy code
source $HOME/.cargo/env
Verify installation:

bash
Copy code
rustc --version
cargo --version
3. Run the Hello World Program
bash
Copy code
cargo run
✅ Expected output:

Copy code
Hello, Rust!
🛠️ Requirements
OS: Linux / MacOS / Windows

Editor: VS Code + Rust Analyzer

Rust Toolchain: rustc, cargo (installed via rustup)

🔍 Common Issues & Fixes
Issue	Fix
cargo: command not found	Run source $HOME/.cargo/env or restart terminal
Missing semicolon error	Remember every statement ends with ; in Rust
No syntax highlighting	Install Rust Analyzer in VS Code

📓 Learning with AI Prompts
Some example prompts I used with AI:

“Explain the basics of Rust programming for a beginner.”

“Give me step-by-step instructions to install Rust on Linux.”

“List common errors when starting with Rust and how to fix them.”

✨ Reflection: AI helped me get unstuck quickly, especially with setup issues and debugging.
