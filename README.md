### 🦀 Rust Beginner’s Toolkit – Moringa AI Capstone

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is part of the Moringa AI Capstone. The goal is to learn a new technology (Rust) using AI prompts and create a beginner-friendly toolkit that helps others get started.

## This repo contains:

1. A Hello World Rust project

2. Documentation on setup & usage

3. Notes on AI prompts used, reflections, and troubleshooting

### 🎯 Objectives

- Install Rust and Cargo

- Run a minimal working “Hello World” program

- Document the setup steps and issues encountered

- Share AI prompt experiences for learning

### ⚡ Quick Start

1. Clone the Repository

- git clone https://github.com/your-username/rust-capstone.git

- cd rust-hello-world

2. Install Rust

- curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

- source $HOME/.cargo/env

3. Run the Program

- cargo run


### ✅ Expected Output:

Hello, world!

### 🛠️ Requirements

- OS: Linux / Mac / Windows

- Editor: VS Code + Rust Analyzer extension

- Packages: Rust toolchain (rustc, cargo)

### 🔍 Common Issues & Fixes

- cargo not found: Run source $HOME/.cargo/env or restart terminal.

- Missing semicolon error: Rust requires ; at the end of statements.

- No syntax highlighting: Install the Rust Analyzer VS Code extension
.

### 📓 AI Prompt Journal (Highlights)

1. “Give me a step-by-step guide to set up Rust and run my first program.”
→ Helped scaffold setup & run Hello World.

2. “I’m getting a ‘cargo not found’ error after installation. How do I fix it?”
→ Solution: source $HOME/.cargo/env.

3. “Explain what Cargo does in Rust in simple terms.”
→ Cargo = package manager + build system.
